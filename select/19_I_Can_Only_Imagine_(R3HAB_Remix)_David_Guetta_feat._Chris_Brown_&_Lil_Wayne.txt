Where you been
Where you been all my life
Baby it's a sin
The way you look in that light

It's obvious
That I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

Every touch, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine,
Only imagine what it'd be like

Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like, what it'd be like, like, like
Like, like, like, like...

Every touch, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like

What it'd be like, what it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like...
