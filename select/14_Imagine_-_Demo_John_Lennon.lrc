[00:01.47] Okay?
[00:03.22] So let's go
[00:08.72] 
[00:18.88] Imagine there's no heaven
[00:25.55] It's easy if you try
[00:32.01] No hell below us
[00:39.03] Above us only sky
[00:47.53] 
[00:44.71] Imagine all the people
[00:50.87] Living for today
[00:58.87] 
[00:58.79] Imagine there's no countries
[01:05.29] It isn't hard to do
[01:12.09] Nothing to kill or die for
[01:18.22] And no religion too
[01:27.72] 
[01:24.23] Imagine all the people
[01:30.28] Living life in peace, you
[01:42.78] 
[01:37.65] You may say I'm a dreamer
[01:44.34] But I'm not the only one
[01:50.60] I hope some day you'll join us
[01:57.19] And the world will be as one
[02:11.19] 
[02:04.62] Imagine no possessions
[02:11.08] I wonder if you can
[02:16.95] No need for greed or hunger
[02:23.52] A brotherhood of man
[02:33.52] 
[02:29.61] Imagine all the people
[02:35.52] Sharing all the world, you
[02:48.52] 
[02:42.89] You may say I'm a dreamer
[02:49.77] But I'm not the only one
[02:55.65] I hope some day you'll join us
[03:02.14] And the world will be as one
[03:16.14] 
[03:11.22] Would you mind saying this things without music?
[03:13.16] Yeah, after (okay)
[03:14.60] Okay? Tell me when
