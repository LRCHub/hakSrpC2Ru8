[00:14.58] Imagine there's no heaven
[00:20.61] It's easy if you try
[00:27.14] No hell below us
[00:34.02] Above us only sky
[00:39.71] Imagine all the people
[00:45.56] Living for today, I
[00:55.06] 
[00:53.26] Imagine there's no countries
[00:59.15] It isn't hard to do
[01:05.41] Nothing to kill or die for
[01:11.77] And no religion too
[01:17.62] Imagine all the people
[01:23.59] Living life in peace
[01:33.59] 
[01:30.83] You may say I'm a dreamer
[01:37.42] But I'm not the only one
[01:43.37] I hope someday you'll join us
[01:50.39] And the world will be as one
[02:04.39] 
[01:56.10] Imagine no possessions
[02:02.31] I wonder if you can
[02:08.22] No need for greed or hunger
[02:14.62] A brotherhood of man
[02:21.00] Imagine all the people
[02:26.70] Sharing all the world, you
[02:39.70] 
[02:34.36] You may say I'm a dreamer
[02:40.47] But I'm not the only one
[02:46.44] I hope someday you'll join us
[02:53.51] And the world will live as one
