When i close my eyes
I can see you
Reach out to me
In my deepest dream
I can hear you
Call out to me
Where in the world are you tonight?
Did i imagine you?
Did i imagine you?
Are you somebody real?
That i can touch and feel?
Here in my dreams
I'm waiting for you
Just take my hand
I'll carry you through
Now and then it seems
I can hear you
Climb the stairs
And opening the door
I realize you're not there
Where in the world are you tonight?
Did i imagine you?
Did i imagine you?
Are you somebody real?
That i can touch and feel?
Here in my dreams
I'm waiting for you
Just take my hand
I'll carry you through
Here in my dreams
I'm waiting for you
Just take my hand
I'll carry you through
